﻿﻿Hi guys,I am Abdullah Baş.Today I will talk about some of the visualization techniques. But first let me start with the tradition.*****_Ulu çınarlar fırtınalı diyarlarda yetişir.-Cemil Meriç  -"Great plane trees grow in stormy lands"_********** #_I will continue data visualization on  deep learning models and medical images. Also I will publish MATLAB version of this repo soon_ #Let's start with the line plots. These are quite useful when trying show  effects of something or changes among time or other stream. Nearly all of the plots demonstrated on iris dataset. All of the plots and codes that shown in the following are present in this repo###Area Plot#Area plot is the one of the most using line plots.![Area Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/areaplot.png?raw=true)###Radar -Spider Plot#Actuallly this plot arguably  the most used  plot in the tistory . FM Players, FIFA , PES and bilimum games have been widely used this plot. Besides all of that this is the plot that I am most familiar with-of course because of the FIFA- . I am sorry academia but this plot belongs to the gamers… Sad story..##![RadarPlot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/radarPlot.png?raw=true)## Line PlotFollowing visualization is for demonstration  of subplots![Line Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/linesSubplots.png?raw=true)## Focused Line PlotYou can see the lines that I focus are colored but the other ones are shaded.![Focused Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/focusedline.png?raw=true)####Violin PlotThese plots are very similar to box plots.#![Violin Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/violinPlot.png?raw=true)##Box PlotThese plots are very useful plots on investigation of data summary.#![Box Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/boxplot.png?raw=true)####Parallel PlotThese plots are very useful while investigating sequential features like  DL model hyperparameters.#![Paralllel Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/paralelLine.png?raw=true)### Venn Diagrams#![Paralllel Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/vennDiagrams.png?raw=true)##Regression Plot#![Regression Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/correlation.png?raw=true)##Correlation Plot#![Correlation Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/correlationplot2.png?raw=true)## Contour-Marginal Plot#![Contour Plot](https://github.com/abdullahbas/DataVisualization/blob/main/images/marginalContour.png?raw=true)#I want to give credit to the documentation of matplotlib seaborn and pandas.Also I want to give credit to the python graph gallery [WormHole to Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) and also Yan Holtz [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yan-holtz-2477534a/?ppe=1)
